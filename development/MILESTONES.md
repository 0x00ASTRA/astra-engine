# Project Milestones

## Flappy Bird Clone (Current Focus)

**Goal:** Implement the core engine features necessary to develop a simple Flappy Bird clone.

### Key Features Required:

*   **2D Rendering:**
    *   Implement drawing for rectangles (filled and outlined).
    *   Implement drawing for textures (sprites).
    *   Implement basic text rendering (for score).
    *   Implement FPS counter display.
*   **2D Physics:**
    *   Basic AABB collision detection.
    *   Simple gravity and velocity application.
*   **Input:**
    *   Handle basic keyboard/mouse input for player control.
*   **Asset Management:**
    *   Load and manage textures efficiently.

### Definition of Done:

*   A playable Flappy Bird clone can be created using the engine's exposed APIs.
*   All required 2D rendering primitives are functional.
*   Basic physics (gravity, collision) is implemented and stable.
*   Input handling is robust enough for game control.
*   Assets (textures) can be loaded and rendered.
