# ‚ú® Astra Engine ‚ú®

A modular game engine built with Zig, using SDL2 for cross-platform windowing and rendering, and Lua for scripting game logic.

> [!WARNING]
> **This project is in a very early stage of development.** While the main branch is expected to build and run, the engine is not yet feature-complete and is not ready for serious game development.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

*   **Zig-Powered:** Written in the Zig programming language for performance and safety.
*   **SDL2 Integration:** Utilizes SDL2 for window and renderer management.
*   **Lua Scripting:** Embeds a Lua scripting environment for flexible game logic.
*   **Modular Design:** Features a manager-based architecture for clear separation of concerns (windowing, rendering, assets, scripting).
*   **TOML Configuration:** Uses TOML for easy and readable configuration files.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **Language:** Zig
*   **Graphics/Windowing:** SDL2 (via `SDL.zig`)
*   **Scripting:** Lua (via `zlua`)
*   **Configuration:** TOML (via `zig-toml`)

---

## üìã Prerequisites

*   **Zig Compiler:** Version `0.14.0` or later (as specified in `build.zig.zon`). You can download it from the [official Zig website](https://ziglang.org/download/).
*   **SDL2:** You need to have the SDL2 library installed on your system.

## üì¶ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/0x00ASTRA/astra-engine.git
    cd astra-engine
    ```

2.  **Build the project:**
    The Zig build system will automatically fetch dependencies and compile the project.
    ```bash
    zig build
    ```
    This will create the executable in the `zig-out/bin/` directory.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Build Commands

The `build.zig` file defines the following commands:

*   `zig build`: Compiles the engine and places the executable in `zig-out/bin/`.
*   `zig build run`: Compiles and runs the engine.
*   `zig build test`: Runs the unit tests.
*   `zig build gemini`: Runs the Gemini AI project management workflow.

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage / Getting Started

To run the engine after building:
```bash
zig build run
```

Alternatively, you can execute the compiled binary directly from the build output directory:
```bash
./zig-out/bin/AstraEngine
```

*   `src/`: Contains the main Zig source code for the engine.
*   `assets/`: Holds graphics, sounds, and other resources.
*   `scripts/`: Contains Lua scripts for game logic.
*   `config/`: TOML files for engine and game settings.
*   `build.zig`: Defines how the project is built.
*   `build.zig.zon`: Defines the Zig package and its dependencies.

## üîß Configuration

Engine and window settings are configured in `config/window.toml`.

## ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development

This project uses a **Gemini AI agent** for project management and planning. The agent's purpose is to help organize the development process, track tasks, and maintain a clear roadmap.

### The Gemini Workflow

The core of the AI-assisted workflow is defined in the `GEMINI.md` file. The agent has read-only access to the source code and can only write to the planning documents located in the `development/` directory:

*   `development/ROADMAP.md`: Long-term goals and feature milestones.
*   `development/TASKS.md`: Individual tasks (backlog, in-progress, done).
*   `development/DECISIONS.md`: A log of important technical decisions.

To initiate the Gemini workflow, you can use the following build command:

```bash
zig build gemini
```

> [!NOTE]
> This command requires the [`gemini-cli`](https://github.com/google/gemini-cli) to be installed and available in your system's PATH.

This command will trigger the agent to analyze the current state of the project and update the planning documents accordingly. The agent **will not** modify any source code.
